- 👋 Hi, I’m @outerspec
- 👀 I’m interested in making my own websites for fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything.

- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/??? idk
- ⚡ Fun fact: My dad is a libertarian, and he wouldn't let me watch "Aladdin" as a child because he didn't like the fact that the main character steals.
